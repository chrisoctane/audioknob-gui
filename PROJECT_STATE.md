# audioknob-gui: project state log

## Guardrails (non-negotiable)

- No system changes without an explicit **Preview → Confirm → Apply**.
- Every apply is a **transaction** with backups + manifest; undo is always possible.
- Keep UI simple; advanced info is optional.

## Status

- Repo skeleton: in progress.
- Knob registry schema + initial catalog: pending.
- Privileged worker (pkexec): pending.
- GUI (Qt/PySide6): pending.
